📘 Project Overview

This project is a web-based resource library developed as part of the Full Stack Application Development (FSAD) course. The platform is designed to organize and provide easy access to educational materials such as textbooks, research papers, and study guides. It includes role-based access, where administrators can upload and manage resources, and users can search, view, and download materials. The front-end is built using React JS with a focus on clean UI, smooth navigation, and usability, aiming to enhance learning and research efficiency.
